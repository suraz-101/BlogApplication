         1. In the 'server' directory, create a '.env' file and define the environment variables that are mentioned in '.env.example' file of the server

    6. Install all the dependencies and devDependensies  that are mentioned on server side file called 'package.json'


        npm i <dependency name> --save  => run this code to download the packages mentioned on dependencies


        npm i <dependecy name> --save -dev   => run this code to download the packages mentioned on devDependecies

    7. Iinstall all the dependencies  that are mentioned on server side file called 'package.json'

         npm i <dependency name> --save  => run this code to download the packages mentioned on dependencies



    8. start server

        npm run dev


    9. start client

        npm run dev

    10. Access the application

        - Open your web browser and navigate to "link mentioned after running npm run dev in client terminal" to access the blog application

To setup mongodb and to copy the url of you mongodb please watch [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/)

These installation instructions should guide users through setting up the MERN Blog Application project locally on their machine. Adjust the steps as needed based on your project's structure and dependencies.

# Technologies used

1. MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing blog posts, user information, and other data related to the application.

2. Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend server and API endpoints for handling HTTP requests and responses.

3. React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this project, React.js is used to create the frontend interface of the blog application, including components for displaying blog posts, user authentication, and more.

4. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running server-side code. In this project, Node.js is used to host the backend server that serves the RESTful API and interacts with the database.

5. Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests from the frontend React.js components to the backend Express.js server.

6. Redux-tool-kit: A predictable state container for JavaScript applications. Redux is used for managing application state in a centralized store, enabling efficient data management and state synchronization across components.

7. React Router: A library for declarative routing in React.js applications. React Router is used to handle client-side routing and navigation within the blog application.

8. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are used for user authentication and authorization in the blog application.

9. Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose is used to define schemas, models, and interact with the MongoDB database in a more structured way.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
